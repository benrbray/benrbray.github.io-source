Summary:  Things I learned while making this website.  Web standards change quickly!

# Overview

This is a static website hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  I use [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to convert Markdown

Modern HTML/CSS are extremely expressive, so I avoid using JavaScript as much as possible.  When JavaScript would allow for more interactivity than possible using HTML/CSS alone, I always try to include a fallback for users who choose to disable JS for security or performance reasons.

Before this redesign, my personal site, like many others, had been perpetually under construction.
