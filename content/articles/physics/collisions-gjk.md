Summary: The Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi distance algorithm is a method of determining the minimum distance between two convex sets. Unlike many other distance algorithms, it does not require that the geometry data be stored in any specific format, but instead relies solely on a support function to iteratively generate closer simplices to the correct answer using the configuration space obstacle (CSO) of two convex shapes, more commonly known as the Minkowski difference.
